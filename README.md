# Exploding-Gators
A spin-off of the Exploding Kittens card game!

## Inspiration

Both of us like card games and thought it would be fun to work on something we enjoyed!

## What it does

Gator-themed version of the exploding kittens card game. Rules and Details can be found here - https://explodingkittens.com/

## How we built it

Most of the code was written from scratch and we had minimal use of libraries as we wanted to learn to build the project from the ground up.

## Challenges we ran into

Once we started implementing some of the key features, we had trouble organizing the code. The virtual limitation was also a factor as we were both working from different cities.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

This is Guillermo's first hackathon! He is currently taking Programming 1 at UF and was excited to use his class coding skills to develop this fun project. Both of us were quite busy on Friday and so we had to start the project on Saturday even so, we were able to finish it entirely in one day!

## What we learned

Rahul - interesting Java tricks, the rules of Exploding Kittens...
Guillermo - Git, Java...

## What's next for Exploding_Gators

We might be out to make more creative Gator themed spin-offs of your favorite games! So stay on the lookout :)
